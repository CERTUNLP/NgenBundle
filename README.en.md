# NGEN

## What is it?

NGEN is a security incident report system created to be used in different types of CSIRTs.
The CERTUNLP, is the CSIRT of the National University of La Plata and was constituted in 2008, since that time we have gone through several options such as GLPI, RT, RITR, Redmine, MantisBT and even a first attempt of own development in PHP flat, until we reach the current development of NGEN, which we use in the daily mission of incident management.

Although CERTUNLP NGEN was born as an incident management system developed for use in the scope of work of the CSIRT of the National University of La Plata, it was subsequently released as free software.


## What is it for?

* Through a web interface allows us to manage computer security incidents that affect our constituency.

* It facilitates our daily task by automating many of the associated actions that we used to do manually.

* Automatically relates to several ** feeds ** or sources of information that feed NGEN reporting incidents. After an incident is created, NGEN notifies those affected.

* Reports sent to those affected provide, in addition to the relevant evidence, documentation that allows them to understand the problem and suggests mechanisms for solution.


## Feeds

Some feeds with which NGEN has already been integrated are:
* Shadowserver
* CERT.br Spampot
* Spamhaus
* Scripts that extract information from Shodan, Censys, etc.
