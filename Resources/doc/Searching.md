## General Search

You can search in any screen of Ngen using the search box at the top left.


## How to use it

  * Ngen uses context for search. For example, if you are in networks list, the search is going to be applied to find a Network in the system.
  * You can search using simple/keyword search, you just enter any term and press search, Ngen will try to match anything in his indexes with this term.
  * You can write your own elastic specific search using the indexes. Take a look at the Section Elastic Indexes.
