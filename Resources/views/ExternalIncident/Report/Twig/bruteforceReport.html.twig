This type of attacks are commonly linked to a malware trying to infect other devices inside or outside the network, or possibly an attacker realizing a network scan. Whichever the case, there direct consequences are:

<ul>
<li><p>Excessive consumption of bandwidth by the host.</p></li>
<li><p>Compromising other hosts.</p></li>
<li><p>etc</p></li>
</ul>
