{% extends father %}{% block problem %}

We would like to inform you that we have been notified that the <em>host/server</em>  {{incident.hostAddress}} has the <strong>Portmap</strong> service, accessible from the Internet.

{% endblock %}


{% block derivated_problem_content %}


<p class="lead">Related issues</p>

The <em>host</em> under your administration could be used to perform <a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-017A">amplification</a> attacks to third party's, like:

<ul>
<li>Denial of Service attacks (DOS, DDOS).</li>
</ul>

Additionally, the <strong>host/servidor</strong> could expose other misconfigured services, such as NFS shared folders.

{% block verification_content %}


<p class="lead">How to verify the issue</p>

To manually verify if the service is vulnerable, use the following command:

<div class = "destacated">

<pre><code>rpcinfo -T udp -p {{incident.hostAddress}}
</code></pre>

</div>

View the NFS shared folders using the command:

<div class = "destacated">

<pre><code>showmount -e {{incident.hostAddress}}
</code></pre>

</div>
