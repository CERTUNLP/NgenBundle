{% block verification_content %}


<p class="lead">How to verify the issue</p>

Due to the report possible being a false positive, we recommend to verify the existence of the vulnerability using the following commands:

<div class = "destacated">

<pre><code>env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
</code></pre>

</div>

If the execution of the previous command returns the string "vulnerable", is most likely that the host has been compromised.

{% block recommendations_content %}


<p class="lead">Recommendations</p>
