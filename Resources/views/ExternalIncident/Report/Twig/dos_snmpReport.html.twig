We recommend:

<em>TODO pasar al español tambien, https://www.bitag.org/report-snmp-ddos-attacks.php</em>
* Users should be allowed and encouraged to disable SNMP.
* End-user devices should not be configured with SNMP on by default.
* End-user devices should not be routinely configured with the “public” SNMP community string.
* Establish firewall rules to filter unauthorized queries.
