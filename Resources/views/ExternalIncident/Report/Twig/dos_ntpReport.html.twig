{% block verification_content %}


<p class="lead">How to verify the issue</p>

The verification can be achieved analyzing the server response to the commands <strong><em>NTP readvar</em></strong> and/or <strong><em>NTP monlist</em></strong>. To manually verify if the service responds to these types of commands, use the following commands:


<div class = "destacated">

<pre><code>ntpq -c readvar [{{incident.hostAddress}}]
ntpdc -n -c monlist [{{incident.hostAddress}}]
</code></pre>

</div>

{% block recommendations_content %}


<p class="lead">Recommendations</p>

To address the <strong><em>NTP readvar</em></strong> issue, we recommend:


<div class = "destacated">

<a href="http://www.team-cymru.org/ReadingRoom/Templates/secure-ntp-template.html">Disable</a>
<code>NTP readvar</code> queries.

</div>

To address the <strong><em>NTP monlist</em></strong> issue, we recommend:


<div class = "destacated">

Versions of <code>ntpd</code> previous to 4.2.7 are vulnerable. Therefore, we recommend upgrading to the latest version available.
If upgrading is not possible, as an alternative disable <code>monlist</code>.
