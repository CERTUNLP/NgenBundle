{% extends father %}{% block problem %}

We would like to inform you that we have been notified that the <em>host</em> {{incident.hostAddress}} is being used to perform Denial of Service attacks (DOS), through the <strong>chargen</strong> service (UDP port 19).

{% endblock %}


{% block verification_content %}


<p class="lead">How to verify the issue</p>

The verification can be achieved analyzing the existing network traffic and observing UDP datagrams from and towards the port 19. Alternatively, it can be verified by manually connecting to the service using the following command:

<div class = "destacated">

<pre><code>ncat -u {{incident.hostAddress}} 19
</code></pre>

</div>


{% endblock %}


{% block recommendations_content %}


<p class="lead">Recommendations</p>

We recommend:

<div class = "destacated">

<ul>
<li>Disable corresponding service.</li>
<li>Establish firewall rules to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic in the port 19/UDP.</li>
</ul>

</div>
